## Next.js to-do app with RESTful API created with Mongoose
My first CRUD app and RESTful API.
Edit: In order for it to work in deployment in this case we can just put the project in a VPS or make the API seperate from the project but then connect the project to the API and the API to the database, no need for a learning purpose project.

## Tools used:
- Next.js 14 (JavaScript, Tailwind)
- Mongoose (ODM - i.e. make the queries to the MongoDB database in the API endpoint)
- MongoDB (our NoSQL database)
