## Next.js to-do app with RESTful API created with Mongoose

The app works good however the API endpoint is "http://localhost:3000/api/todos" so you'll need to provide a .env file with a URI for a MongoDB database, then after local run the app works just fine and connects and does all the CRUD operations with your MongoDB database with the built-in Mongoose RESTful api.
