## Next.js to-do app with RESTful API created with Mongoose
My first CRUD app and RESTful API.
https://github.com/YonatanToker/CRUD-todo-app-restfulAPI-Mongoose/assets/116793943/b9b94648-333e-462a-bcf9-b65a206fc5ee

The app works good however the API endpoint is "http://localhost:3000/api/todos" so you'll need to provide a .env file with a URI for a MongoDB database, then after local run the app works just fine and connects and does all the CRUD operations with your MongoDB database with the built-in Mongoose RESTful api.
## Tools used:
- Next.js 14 (JavaScript, Tailwind)
- Mongoose (ODM)
- MongoDB (database)
